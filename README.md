## What Is a Video to Fiber Converter?

A video to fiber converter is an active signal conversion device that converts analog video signals into optical signals for transmission over single-mode or multimode fiber optic cabling. At the receiving end, the signal is converted back to video for display or recording.

These converters are commonly purchased for surveillance and monitoring systems where copper cabling limitations prevent reliable long-distance video transmission.

Typical purchasing considerations include:
- buying a video to fiber converter for long-distance CCTV installations  
- selecting analog video over fiber equipment for EMI-sensitive environments  
- upgrading legacy coax-based surveillance systems to fiber optic infrastructure

## Why Convert Video Signals to Fiber Optic Transmission?

Analog video signals transmitted over coaxial cable are limited by distance, signal attenuation, and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. Fiber optic transmission eliminates these issues while enabling significantly longer transmission distances.

A video to fiber converter is used to:
- transmit analog video signals over long-distance fiber optic cable  
- eliminate interference caused by electrical noise or lightning  
- improve video signal reliability in industrial and outdoor environments
